I was not able to get it to compile, I still have a compiler error that I dont understand
But here is how to make it

run:
cmake .
make
./a.out inputFile OutputFile



I probably started and restarted this project 4 or 5 times. Each time understanding it more and more.
I ended up stumbling accross someone elses example. As I continued to experience compiler errors I
started following their implementation more and more closely(https://github.com/EBirch/CPSL-Compiler).
Right now I just want to get it to compilebut its almost 12:00 so I am turning it in for partial credit.
